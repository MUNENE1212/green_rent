## IntaSend Integration Notes

### Ready for Production:
The payment system is structured to integrate with IntaSend. To complete integration:

1. **Environment Variables Needed:**
```env
INTASEND_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
INTASEND_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
INTASEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

2. **Install IntaSend SDK:**
```bash
npm install intasend-node
```

3. **Webhook URL:**
```
POST https://your-domain.com/api/v1/payments/webhook
```

4. **Supported Payment Methods:**
- M-Pesa (STK Push)
- Card (Visa, Mastercard)
- Bank Transfer

Currently using mock payment completion for testing. Uncomment IntaSend code in `payment.controller.js` when ready.

---

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Payment Flow Testing:
```javascript
// Test payment initiation
POST /api/v1/payments/initiate
{
  "leaseId": "...",
  "amount": 5000,
  "type": "rent",
  "paymentMethod": "mpesa",
  "useWallet": true,
  "walletAmount": 1000
}

// Test webhook (simulate IntaSend callback)
POST /api/v1/payments/webhook
{
  "state": "COMPLETE",
  "transaction_id": "TXN123",
  "api_ref": "payment_id_here"
}
```

### 2. Booking Flow Testing:
```javascript
// Create virtual viewing booking
POST /api/v1/bookings
{
  "unitId": "...",
  "bookingType": "virtual_viewing",
  "skipPhysicalViewing": true
}

// Track virtual viewing
PUT /api/v1/bookings/:id/track-virtual-viewing
{
  "viewed360Tour": true,
  "watchedVideo": true,
  "viewedPhotos": 20,
  "totalViewTime": 300
}

// Convert to lease
POST /api/v1/bookings/:id/convert-to-lease
```

### 3. Lease Flow Testing:
```javascript
// Create lease
POST /api/v1/leases
{
  "unitId": "...",
  "tenantId": "...",
  "startDate": "2025-11-01",
  "endDate": "2026-10-31",
  "monthlyRent": 30000,
  "deposit": 60000
}

// Tenant signs
PUT /api/v1/leases/:id/sign
{
  "signature": "base64_signature_data"
}

// Landlord signs
PUT /api/v1/leases/:id/sign
{
  "signature": "base64_signature_data"
}

// Activate lease
PUT /api/v1/leases/:id/activate
```

## Database Considerations

### Indexes Created:
All critical queries are indexed:
- Payment status & tenant/landlord lookups
- Booking status & expiry dates
- Lease status & end dates
- Unit availability status

### Recommended Cron Jobs (TODO):
1. **Expire old reservations** - Every hour
   ```javascript
   await Booking.expireOldReservations();
   ```

2. **Find expiring leases** - Daily
   ```javascript
   const expiring = await Lease.findExpiringLeases(30);
   // Send notifications
   ```

3. **Calculate rent wallet interest** - Monthly
   ```javascript
   POST /api/v1/rent-wallets/calculate-interest
   ```
