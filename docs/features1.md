## Making Renting Easy and Affordable for Everyone

## THE PROBLEM (What's Wrong Today)

### For People Looking for Houses (Tenants)

**Meet Jane - A Young Professional**

Jane just got her first job in Nairobi. She earns KES 60,000 per month. She found a nice apartment for KES 30,000/month.

**But here's the problem:**

The landlord wants:
- KES 30,000 for the first month
- KES 60,000 for deposit (2 months)
- **Total: KES 90,000 upfront!**

Jane only has KES 40,000 saved. She can't afford this house, even though she can easily pay KES 30,000 every month.

**Meet Mary - House Help**

Mary works as a house help in Nairobi. She earns KES 12,000 per month. She found a nice single room for KES 3,000/month.

**Her problem is different but just as hard:**

- She earns daily but gets paid monthly
- Hard to save KES 3,000 at once
- By end of month, money already spent on other emergencies
- Landlord won't accept daily or weekly payments
- **She can afford KES 100 per day easily, but not KES 3,000 at once**

**Also:**
- Landlords don't answer calls quickly
- You don't know if the price is fair
- You can't pay in smaller amounts (weekly or bi-weekly)
- No way to build your rental history (like a credit score)
- **You waste time viewing houses that are already taken** - The website still shows them as available!
- **Can't see inside before visiting** - Only 2-3 photos of the outside, no idea what rooms look like
- **Waste money on transport** - Visit 5 houses, 3 don't match photos, 1 already taken
- **If you're relocating** - Impossible to find house from another city
- **Someone else takes your dream house** - You saw it yesterday, decided today, but it's gone

### For House Owners (Landlords)

**Meet Mr. Kamau - Property Owner**

Mr. Kamau owns 10 apartments. Every day he faces these problems:

- **Empty houses cost him money** - Takes 3-4 months to find tenants
- **Poor quality photos lose tenants** - His phone photos don't do property justice
- **Can't reach people from other cities** - Misses tenants relocating to the area
- **Managing viewings is chaos** - 10 people want to see same house, scheduling nightmare, some don't show up
- **Time wasters** - People view the house then disappear, no commitment
- **Too many disruptions** - Current tenants annoyed by constant viewings
- **Collecting rent is stressful** - Calling tenants every month, some pay late
- **Paperwork everywhere** - Lease agreements, receipts, utility bills all on paper
- **Hard to manage** - Driving to properties to check on things
- **Not sure about pricing** - Is he charging too much or too little?
- **Houses get taken while he's still showing them** - Serious tenant ready to commit but he showed to someone else first

## WHY GREENRENT IS SPECIAL

### The Secret Sauce: Technology + Financial Inclusion

**1. Rent Wallet & Micro-Savings (First in the World!)**

**Nobody else offers this:**
- Save ANY amount, ANYTIME (minimum KES 10)
- Daily, weekly, monthly - your choice
- Automatic rent payment when target reached
- **Perfect for low-income earners** (house helps, casual workers, small business owners)
- Earn interest while saving (0.5% monthly)
- Gamification: Bonuses, streaks, rewards!
- **Breaking the cycle of poverty through accessible housing**

**Why This Matters:**
```
Traditional System:
House help earning KES 12,000/month
→ Can't save KES 3,000 at once
→ Lives in terrible conditions
→ Stuck in poverty

GreenRent System:
Same house help
→ Saves KES 100 daily (easy!)
→ Gets clean single room
→ Dignity and security
→ Can focus on improving life
```

**2. Real-Time Availability**

Never waste time viewing occupied houses:
- See ONLY vacant units
- Real-time updates (house rented 5 minutes ago? Removed instantly)
- Book viewings for available times
- Reserve your choice before someone else takes it
- Like booking a hotel room - but for long-term rental

**2. Booking System**

First rental platform in Kenya with this:
- Reserve a house like you'd reserve a flight ticket
- Small booking fee holds it for you
- No more "sorry, someone else took it yesterday"
- Protects both tenant and landlord
- Fair cancellation policy

**3. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

Think of it like having a smart assistant that:
- Suggests the best rent price for your house
- Recommends the best payment plan for each person
- Predicts which tenants will pay on time

## THE MARKET (Big Opportunity)

### Simple Math:

- **8 million people** rent houses in Kenyan cities
- **Average rent: KES 25,000** per month
- **Total market: KES 200 BILLION** every year

**Current Situation:**
- 95% of rentals still done the old way (cash, paper, stress)
- Only 5% use any technology
- Huge opportunity for us

**Our Target:**
- Year 1: 1,000 properties (0.001% of market)
- Year 3: 15,000 properties
- Year 5: 100,000+ properties across East Africa

---

## HOW WE MAKE MONEY

### Super Simple Model:

**We Take a Small Commission**
- Every time rent is paid, we keep 5%
- If someone pays KES 30,000 rent, we get KES 1,500
- That's all!

**Example Math:**
```
1,000 properties × KES 30,000 average rent = KES 30 million/month
Our 5% = KES 1.5 million per month
Per year = KES 18 million

With 10,000 properties = KES 180 million per year
```

**Optional Extra Income:**
- Featured property listings (KES 2,000/month)
- **Professional photography service** (KES 5,000-8,000 one-time)
- **Video production service** (KES 8,000-12,000 one-time)
- **360° Virtual tour creation** (KES 10,000-15,000 one-time)
- Tenant background checks (KES 1,000 per check)
- Insurance partnerships (commission)

**Note**: Landlords can take their own photos for free, or use our professional services for faster rental.

### Why This Works:

- **Landlords don't pay anything upfront** - We only earn when they earn
- **Tenants don't pay extra** - The 5% comes from the rent, not as an additional fee
- **Everyone wins** - Better service = Happy customers = More growth

## WHO WE'RE HELPING

### Real People, Real Stories

**Story 1: Mary - House Help (Low Income Earner)**

*"I work as a house help earning KES 12,000 per month. I was living in a very bad place because I could never save KES 3,000 at once for rent. With GreenRent, I started depositing KES 100 every day to my rent wallet. Sometimes KES 50, sometimes KES 150 - whatever I had. After 27 days, I had enough for my rent! The app paid automatically. Now I have a clean single room near my work. I save KES 100-150 daily like clockwork. Best decision ever!"*

**Impact:** Financial inclusion for daily wage earners - gave access to decent housing

---

**Story 2: Sarah - University Student**

*"I'm in my third year at UoN. I work part-time and make about KES 15,000 per month. With GreenRent, I found a bedsitter for KES 8,000 that I can pay KES 2,000 every week. Before, no landlord would rent to me because I couldn't pay deposit."*

**Impact:** Gave access to housing for students

---

**Story 3: James - Uber Driver**

*"My income changes every week. Some weeks I make KES 25,000, others KES 15,000. GreenRent lets me pay weekly, so when I have a good week, I pay. I'm never behind on rent anymore."*

**Impact:** Flexible payments for gig workers

---

**Story 4: David - Relocating Professional**

*"I got a job in Nairobi but I live in Kisumu. I only had one weekend to find a house. With GreenRent, I viewed 12 properties virtually on Friday night. Saturday morning, I applied to my favorite, paid the booking fee, signed the lease digitally. Monday I moved in. I only visited Nairobi once - to move in. Saved me time and KES 10,000 in transport."*

**Impact:** Virtual viewing enables relocation, saves time and money

---

**Story 5: Mrs. Wanjiru - Landlord**

*"I have 6 apartments in Ruaka. Before GreenRent, I spent 5 hours every week collecting rent, keeping records, calling tenants. Now everything is automatic. I get money every week without doing anything. I even raised my occupancy from 70% to 100%."*

**Impact:** More income, less work for landlords
